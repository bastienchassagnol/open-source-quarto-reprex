  abstract = {Written by one of the preeminent researchers in the field, this book provides a comprehensive exposition of modern analysis of causation. It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics, philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social sciences. Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic, manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the relationships between causal connections and statistical associations. Cited in more than 2,100 scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers readers' questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent advances in this field of research.},

 abstract = {
An accessible and contemporary introduction to the methods
for determining cause and effect in the social sciences
Causal inference encompasses the tools that allow social scientists
to determine what causes what. Economists-who generally can't run
controlled experiments to test and validate their hypotheses-apply
these tools to observational data to make connections. In a messy
world, causal inference is what helps establish the causes and
effects of the actions being studied, whether the impact (or lack
thereof) of increases in the minimum wage on employment, the
effects of early childhood education on incarceration later in
life, or the introduction of malaria nets in developing regions on
economic growth. Scott Cunningham introduces students and
practitioners to the methods necessary to arrive at meaningful
answers to the questions of causation, using a range of modeling
techniques and coding instructions for both the R and Stata
programming languages.

  abstract = {Misinterpretation and abuse of statistical tests, confidence intervals, and statistical power have been decried for decades, yet remain rampant. A key problem is that there are no interpretations of these concepts that are at once simple, intuitive, correct, and foolproof. Instead, correct use and interpretation of these statistics requires an attention to detail which seems to tax the patience of working scientists. This high cognitive demand has led to an epidemic of shortcut definitions and interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes disastrously so—and yet these misinterpretations dominate much of the scientific literature. In light of this problem, we provide definitions and a discussion of basic statistics that are more general and critical than typically found in traditional introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a resource for instructors, researchers, and consumers of statistics whose knowledge of statistical theory and technique may be limited but who wish to avoid and spot misinterpretations. We emphasize how violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such as selecting analyses for presentation based on the P values they produce) can lead to small P values even if the declared test hypothesis is correct, and can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis is incorrect. We then provide an explanatory list of 25 misinterpretations of P values, confidence intervals, and power. We conclude with guidelines for improving statistical interpretation and reporting.},

abstract = {The P value is a measure of statistical evidence that appears in virtually all medical research papers. Its interpretation is made extraordinarily difficult because it is not part of any formal system of statistical inference. As a result, the P value's inferential meaning is widely and often wildly misconstrued, a fact that has been pointed out in innumerable papers and books appearing since at least the 1940s. This commentary reviews a dozen of these common misinterpretations and explains why each is wrong. It also reviews the possible consequences of these improper understandings or representations of its meaning. Finally, it contrasts the P value with its Bayesian counterpart, the Bayes' factor, which has virtually all of the desirable properties of an evidential measure that the P value lacks, most notably interpretability. The most serious consequence of this array of P-value misconceptions is the false belief that the probability of a conclusion being in error can be calculated from the data in a single experiment without reference to external evidence or the plausibility of the underlying mechanism.}

In particular, investigators often make these mistakes: 1) P-hacking, which is when you reanalyze a data set in many different ways, or perhaps reanalyze with additional replicates, until you get the result you want; 2) overemphasis on P values rather than on the actual size of the observed effect; 3) overuse of statistical hypothesis testing, and being seduced by the word {\textquotedblleft}significant{\textquotedblright}; and 4) over-reliance on standard errors, which are often misunderstood.},

    abstract = { When assignment to treatment group is made solely on the basis of the value of a covariate, X, effort should be concentrated on estimating the conditional expectations of the dependent variable Y given X in the treatment and control groups. One then averages the difference between these conditional expectations over the distribution of X in the relevant population. There is no need for concern about “other” sources of bias, e.g., unreliability of X, unmeasured background variables. If the conditional expectations are parallel and linear, the proper regression adjustment is the simple covariance adjustment. However, since the quality of the resulting estimates may be sensitive to the adequacy of the underlying model, it is wise to search for nonparallelism and nonlinearity in these conditional expectations. Blocking on the values of X is also appropriate, although the quality of the resulting estimates may be sensitive to the coarseness of the blocking employed. In order for these techniques to be useful in practice, there must be either substantial overlap in the distribution of X in the treatment groups or strong prior information. }

In the example considered here, randomized experiments were conducted in eight schools to determine the effectiveness of special coaching programs for the SAT. The purpose here is to illustrate Bayesian and empirical Bayesian techniques that can be used to help summarize the evidence in such data about differences among treatments, thereby obtaining improved estimates of the treatment effect in each experiment, including the one having the largest observed effect. Three main tools are illustrated: 1) graphical techniques for displaying sensitivity within an empirical Bayes framework, 2) simple simulation techniques for generating Bayesian posterior distributions of individual effects and the largest effect, and 3) methods for monitoring the adequacy of the Bayesian model specification by simulating the posterior predictive distribution in hypothetical replications of the same treatments in the same eight schools. }

Sci. 12 (1997), no. 1, 48--52; MR1466430], but shall use this Preface to indicate the principal changes from the second edition [E. L. Lehmann, Testing statistical hypotheses, Second edition, Wiley, New York, 1986; MR0852406 (87j:62001)]. ``The present volume is divided into two parts. Part I (Chapters 1--10) treats small-sample theory, while Part II (Chapters 11--15) treats large-sample theory. The preface to the second edition stated that `the most important omission is an adequate treatment of optimality paralleling that given for estimation in the companion volume [E. L. Lehmann and G. Casella, Theory of point estimation, Second edition, Springer, New York, 1998; MR1639875 (99g:62025)]'. We here remedy this failure by treating the difficult topic of asymptotic optimality (in Chapter 13) together with the large-sample tools needed for this purpose (in Chapters 11 and 12). Having developed these tools, we use them in Chapter 14 to give a much fuller treatment of tests of goodness of fit than was possible in the second edition, and in Chapter 15 to provide an introduction to the bootstrap and related techniques. Various large-sample considerations that in the second edition were discussed in earlier chapters now have been moved to Chapter 11.

``Another major addition is a more comprehensive treatment of multiple testing including some recent optimality results. This topic is now presented in Chapter 9. In order to make room for these extensive additions, we had to eliminate some material found in the second edition, primarily the coverage of the multivariate linear hypothesis.

``Except for some of the basic results from Part I, a detailed knowledge of small-sample theory is not required for Part II. In particular, the necessary background should include: Chapter 3, Sections 3.1--3.5, 3.8--3.9; Chapter 4: Sections 4.1--4.4; Chapter 5, Sections 5.1--5.3; Chapter 6, Sections 6.1--6.2; Chapter 7, Sections 7.1--7.2; Chapter 8, Sections 8.1--8.2, 8.4--8.5.'' },

    abstract = "{Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), which offer systematic representations of causal relationships, have become an established framework for the analysis of causal inference in epidemiology, often being used to determine covariate adjustment sets for minimizing confounding bias. DAGitty is a popular web application for drawing and analysing DAGs. Here we introduce the R package ‘dagitty’, which provides access to all of the capabilities of the DAGitty web application within the R platform for statistical computing, and also offers several new functions. We describe how the R package ‘dagitty’ can be used to: evaluate whether a DAG is consistent with the dataset it is intended to represent; enumerate ‘statistically equivalent’ but causally different DAGs; and identify exposure-outcome adjustment sets that are valid for causally different but statistically equivalent DAGs. This functionality enables epidemiologists to detect causal misspecifications in DAGs and make robust inferences that remain valid for a range of different DAGs. The R package ‘dagitty’ is available through the comprehensive R archive network (CRAN) at [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dagitty/]. The source code is available on github at [https://github.com/jtextor/dagitty]. The web application ‘DAGitty’ is free software, licensed under the GNU general public licence (GPL) version 2 and is available at [http://dagitty.net/].}",
